# Oh, hello there!

Hi, and Welcome to my Github! I'm Erinea, an emerging Software Developer and an aspiring Full Stack Developer. I have one year's experience in coding and I'm a graduate of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive course. I'm currently seeking opportunities in front-end development in Melbourne, and I'm also open to remote work. 

## Current Projects

I'm passionate about accessibility and inclusion on the web. I'm currently participating in the <a href="https://remarkable.org.au/events/designathon/ ">Remarkable Designathon</a>, a 4 week immersive online Design Hackathon experience where myself and my four teammates tackle a challenge to develop tech and innnovation for inclusion of people with disabilities. We have selected the challenge listed below regarding eSports. 

Challenge #3 - Inclusive eSports
How might we enable greater inclusion and access to eSports for people with disability to build competitive skills, connect with others and create identity as part of the gaming community?

Stay tuned to hear about our progress! 

## Past Projects

My favourite project to date was a group project called <a href="https://floating-cliffs-04957.herokuapp.com/index.html">The Happy Path</a>, which is a platform to share positive resources during the COVID-19 pandemic. 

I was primarily responsible for the stories component of our application. I created multiple tables that formed our stories database using PostgreSQL and the Ruby on Rails Active Record. I then used Axios to enable the stories to perform the CRUD operations.

I've also leaned into my events and sales experience to create <a href="https://boiling-temple-92123.herokuapp.com/">Loopd</a>, an event database to manage past and upcoming events, designed for return/repeat clients.
